# Angular Ticket Challenge - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement a responsive volleyball ticket booking application with stadium selection and seat map visualization following DDD principles.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Setup Core Services and Mock API

**Commit**: "feat: implement map service with mock API endpoints"

- Add HttpClientModule to app.module.ts
- Create MapService with mock implementations for:
  - GET /map (returns list of map IDs)
  - GET /map/<id> (returns 2D seat array)
  - POST /map/<id>/ticket (simulates ticket purchase)
- Create domain models (Seat, SeatMap, Coordinates)
- Setup routing between components

### Step 2: Implement Stadium List Component

**Commit**: "feat: implement stadium list with navigation"

- Update SalonsListComponent to fetch stadium list from API
- Implement random stadium selection logic
- Add navigation to plan component with map_id parameter
- Style component responsively (mobile, tablet, desktop)

### Step 3: Implement Basic Seat Map Rendering

**Commit**: "feat: implement seat map visualization and interaction"

- Update PlanComponent to fetch and display seat data
- Render seats as clickable elements (0=available, 1=reserved)
- Implement seat selection with color changes
- Add coordinate logging on seat click
- Handle loading and error states

### Step 4: Optimize for Large Maps (Performance)

**Commit**: "perf: implement virtual scrolling for large seat maps"

- Implement virtual scrolling for 100k+ seats
- Use viewport-based rendering to maintain smooth performance
- Optimize seat interaction and state updates
- Add efficient change detection strategy

### Step 5: Implement Ticket Purchase Flow

**Commit**: "feat: add ticket purchase functionality"

- Implement POST request to purchase selected seat
- Add purchase confirmation and error handling
- Update seat status after successful purchase
- Add user feedback (success/error messages)

### Step 6: Responsive Design and Mobile Optimization

**Commit**: "style: implement responsive design and mobile optimization"

- Ensure mobile-first responsive design for all components
- Optimize touch interactions for seat selection
- Add proper navigation between views
- Test and refine on different screen sizes

### Step 7: Add Unit Tests

**Commit**: "test: add unit tests for components and services"

- Test MapService API calls and mock responses
- Test SalonsListComponent rendering and navigation
- Test PlanComponent seat rendering and selection logic
- Test responsive behavior and edge cases

## Technical Requirements Covered

- ✅ Fetch and display stadium maps randomly
- ✅ Seat interaction with color changes and coordinate logging
- ✅ Performance handling for 100k+ seats (virtual scrolling)
- ✅ Mock API implementation
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ Clean, documented code with unit tests
- ✅ No CSS frameworks
- ✅ Meaningful commit messages

## Success Criteria

- Responsive design works on all devices
- Smooth performance with large seat maps
- Clean, testable code following DDD principles
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Complete user journey from stadium selection to ticket purchase
